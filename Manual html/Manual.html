It allows teachers to truly understand their students through data. Vizi provides the transparency and accuracy to identify both students who excel, and those who may be struggling, allowing support to be provided in the crucial early stages.

Teachers can also have view read only access to collections of groups that they are associated to (<a  class="scrollto BackLink" href="#Collections">Collections</a>). This allows a teacher to view all Physics groups if they were Head of Physics, but restrict their ability to create and edit performance data. Teachers can have administration rights, this is designed to restricted to a select few IT staff and allows the user to manage the setup and parameters inn Vizi.

Click the 'Create group type' button to cofirm the creation of a new group. Once a group type is created, a user can create groups of that group type. In the example of sets, a user would be able create sets '7A', '7B', '7C' etc....

                                                - Create group type owner. In most cases a member of IT staff would be the owner.<br>
                                                - Has subject(s) - does the group type need subjects associated to it. For example, you may have subjects associated to 'Sets', but not for 'Forms'.<br>
                                                - Has markbook - does the group type need to have marks recorded for it. For example, you may have want to record marks for both 'Sets' and 'Forms'.<br>

If the group type has already been used throughout Vizi, it can not be retrospectively deleted, rather, there will be an option to disable the group type from future use. This will mean historic data relating to that group type will remain, but it can not be used going forward. Note - rather than deleting and creating a new group type, it is often mroe suitable to rename and edit existing group types.

Or the peformance metrics 'Target application' based on the 'Application' grade type. Each student can be alloacted a grade for these performance metrics for each of their subjects. For example, Joe Bloggs may be alloacted an 'A' for the performanc metric 'Minimun attainment target' in Mathematics. This can then be used throughout Vizi to highlight grades that vary from that performance metric.
