						<h2 class="blogSub">A student's wellbeing</h2>
						<p>
						A student’s wellbeing is based around their sense of comfort, happiness and security in their surroundings. Having a good state of wellbeing creates conditions to learn, to be creative, and cope with the many obstacles a student faces in their academic career. 
						<br><br>
						Some students will have a good state of wellness, naturally being positive and driven, but others will struggle to maintain this state without the proper support and guidance. 
						<br><br>
						Wellness walks hand in hand with mental health. If you have a healthy brain, you often have a good state of wellness - feel good about yourself and can cope with everyday situations. If you struggle with a mental illness, this can often hamper your wellness and make it harder to reach that state wellbeing where you work best. 
						<br><br>
						So, it is safe to assume wellness and mental health are hugely important factors in a students academic career- emotions linked to wellness affect how we work, learn and reach our potential. It’s correlation with academic performance is becoming more and more established. As mental health and wellbeing loses its stigma, the field has been opened up and we are beginning to understand what impact wellbeing and mental health can play in academic development. 
						</p>
						<h2 class="blogSub">How is wellbeing changing in schools?</h2>
						<p>
						The observed increase in mental health issues in schools and colleges is in part due to more widely available services and a more accepting society, meaning more students will and can come forward with their issues. But it is likely this is paired with an increase in mental health issues, especially anxiety in the young, potentially due to the increased pressures to perform and reach targets in their studies. 
						<br><br>
						In a recent study conducted by Journal of American College Health, researchers found a significant increase in the diagnosis and treatment for eight of the 12 mental health conditions examined, with the biggest increases in anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. <sub>(4)</sub>
						<br><br>
						The issue is certainly being acknowledged by the UK government, with £300 million of funding earmarked to provide better support in tackling the problem in UK schools. <sub>(2)</sub>
						</p>
						<h2 class="blogSub">How does wellbeing affect attainment?</h2>
						<p>
						There are a plethora of studies that show how state of mind, wellbeing and mental health have a tangible impact on attainment. It seems obvious, feeling good makes us work better, but this is a relatively new revelation - especially in schools. 
						<br><br>
						According to UK charity Place2Be’s one-on-one counselling service in primary schools, for every £1 spent, the return (in terms of better student job prospects, lower rates of illness and crime) was equated to £6.20 ­– a six fold return. <sub>(2)</sub>
						<br><br>
						Compared to controls, participants in the social and emotional learning (SEL) study demonstrated significantly improved social and emotional skills, attitudes, behavior, and academic performance that reflected an <b>11-percentile-point gain in achievement!M</b><sub>(2)</sub>
						<br><br>
						If we look beyond schools and colleges, it is estimated that globally, the impact of poor mental health on productivity in the workplace is nearly US$2.5 trillion a year<sub>(2)</sub>.
						<br><br>
						If we step away from the statistics, many of us know how anxiety and stress can become extremely destructive. Having to tackle these illnesses whilst going through the most academically intense period of most of our lives will almost certainly have a detrimental impact on performance.

						<h2 class="blogSub">Methods to improve wellbeing in the classroom</h2>
						<p>
						As wellbeing and mental health are becoming a more common talking point in schools, more methods are being explored to improve wellbeing in the classroom:
						<ul>
							<li>Listen and learn - listening to students and understanding their issues, why they are struggling and how you could help. </li>
							<li>Change the culture - Often it is stigmatised to talk about why you are struggling. Creating an atmosphere where it is OK to talk about mental health can help students address any issues they might be coping with. </li>
							<li>Positivity - Positivity is infectious! It works like a chain reaction, promoting positivity in one student can encourage positivity in others. </li>
							<li>Time away from tech - With the advent of social media, it is increasingly common for students to feel marginalised and self-aware.  </li>
							<li>Integration - Promoting integration and relationships amongst your students.</li>
							<li>Ask the question - Make talking about issues the norm. This starts by asking questions.</li>
							<li>Change the definition of success - Success shouldn't just be about an academic level, rather a target relating specifically to a student. </li>
							<li>Exercise - Like meditation, exercise has been shown to boost the levels of alpha waves in the brain, a sign of relaxation<sub>(5)</sub>.  </li>
							<li>Evaluate and assess - keep a track of the effectiveness of what you are doing to promote wellbeing.</li>
						</ul> 
						</p>
						<h2 class="blogSub">Using data to understand and improve student wellbeing?</h2>
						<p>
						So, to the original point of this article -  how can we use data to help understand student wellbeing? It starts with tracking relevant data. Data relating to performance, attendance and behaviour.  
						<br><br>
						It then requires us to identify cues in that data that could signpost issues. It may be that individually these cues may not draw attention and may just be part of the normal fluctuations in any academic career. But cumulatively these cues can be a sign of issues. 
						<br><br>
						What are the sort of cues we can look out for?
						<ul>
							<li>Falls in performance, sudden falls and consistent (Looking at the correlation of results can be useful for this)</li>
							<li>Increased behavioural concerns</li>
							<li>Falls in attendance</li>
							<li>Sporadic performance and behaviour</li>
							<li>Lateness to lessons</li>
							<li>Failure to meet targets</li>
						</ul>
						Although a very new field, there are some  examples of learning analytics solutions that are being implemented in universities - joining the dots, like attendance, academic performance, health visits - and alerting counsellors of warning signs. 
						<br><br>
						It is clear that this is not designed to replace humans as a source of counsel for students, rather optimise the the process of identifying students in need.<sub>(1)</sub>
						<br><br>
						Data is being more widely accepted as a tool to help with pointing you in the right places, but this has to be paired with forming relationships with students, observing, relying on instincts, listening and understanding.
						</p>
						<h2 class="blogSub">Finally</h2>
						<p>
						It is hard to get empirical evidence of a causality between wellbeing and attainment - it is not black and white. What we can say with some confidence is that there is a connection and exploring the nature of that connection, be it on a student by student basis or a whole school policy change, can be used to improve attainment. 
						<br><br>
						So, data alone will not improve wellbeing and shouldn’t be seen as the panacea (at least until AI makes us all obsolete), but it can create far more opportunities to intervene in a students educational and developmental journey!
						<br><br>
						What we try and do at Vizi is take the effort out of recording this data and give ample opportunity for the correct person to make the correct intervention. Please get in touch to find out more -> mike@vizi.education
