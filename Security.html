						<strong>Website Visitors</strong>
						<p>Like most web application providers and website operators, Vizi Education collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Vizi Education's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Vizi Education's visitors use its website and web application. From time to time, Vizi Education may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
						<p>Vizi Education also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Vizi Education does not disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses.</p>

						<strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
						<p>Certain visitors to Vizi Education&rsquo;s websites choose to interact with Vizi Education in ways that require Vizi Education to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Vizi Education gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to Vizi Education to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Vizi Education &ndash; by using the single user version or by purchasing access the enterprise version, for example &ndash; are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Vizi Education collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&rsquo;s interaction with Vizi Education. Vizi Education does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain web application-related activities.</p>

						<strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong>
						<p>Vizi Education may collect statistics about the usage of its web application and website. For instance, Vizi Education may monitor the most popular pages on the web application. Vizi Education may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Vizi Education does not disclose personally-identifying information.</p>

						<strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vizi Education discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Vizi Education&rsquo;s behalf or to provide services available at Vizi Education&rsquo;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Vizi Education&rsquo;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Vizi Education will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Vizi Education discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order or other governmental request, or when Vizi Education believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Vizi Education, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Vizi Education web application and have supplied your email address, Vizi Education may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with Vizi Education and our products. We primarily use our various website blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Vizi Education takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</span></p>

						<strong>Use of web application data during an active account</strong>
						<p>Web application data includes all data submitted to the web application by a user. Vizi Education discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees. We do not disclose your personal data to third parties except as required and permitted by applicable law.</p>
						<p>Vizi Education complies fully with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

						<strong>Cookies</strong>
						<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer, and that the visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Vizi Education uses cookies to help Vizi Education identify and track visitors, their usage of Vizi Education website and web application, and their website access preferences. Vizi Education visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Vizi Education&rsquo;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Vizi Education&rsquo;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

						<strong>Ads</strong>
						<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Vizi Education and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers</p>

						<strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong>
						<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Vizi Education may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Vizi Education&rsquo;s sole discretion. Vizi Education encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Vizi education web application account, you should also check your profile page for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
